Project Description
The Online Booking Store project is designed to offer users a seamless experience when booking services or products online. It includes features such as user registration, product browsing, booking management, payment processing, and order confirmation. The diagrams and use cases included in this project aim to provide a clear visualization of how the system functions and interacts with its components.

Use Case Diagram
Overview
The Use Case Diagram provides a graphical representation of the interactions between different actors (such as customers, admin users, and the system itself) and the various functionalities offered by the Online Booking Store.

Main Use Cases
User Registration/Login: Allows users to create an account or log in.
Browse Products/Services: Users can view the available products or services.
Make a Booking: Users can select and book a product or service.
Payment Processing: Users can pay for the bookings securely.
Manage Bookings: Users can view, edit, or cancel their bookings.
The use case diagram visually maps these interactions, showing which actors are involved in each use case.

Fully Dressed Use Cases
Overview
Fully dressed use cases provide a detailed description of the actions involved in a specific interaction between an actor and the system. They describe the flow of events in a structured way, including preconditions, triggers, main flows, alternative flows, and exceptions.

Example Use Case: Make a Booking
Use Case Name: Make a Booking
Primary Actor: User
Preconditions: User is logged in and browsing the available products/services.
Trigger: User selects a product/service to book.
Main Flow:
The system displays the booking form.
The user fills in the booking details.
The user confirms the booking.
The system processes the booking and provides a confirmation.
Alternative Flows: If the booking process fails, the user receives an error message with further instructions.
Postconditions: The booking is saved, and a confirmation is sent to the user.
System Sequence Diagram
Overview
The System Sequence Diagram (SSD) outlines the sequence of interactions between the user and the system for each use case. It highlights the sequence of messages exchanged, showcasing how the system responds to user inputs.

Example: Make a Booking Sequence
Step 1: User initiates a booking request.
Step 2: The system displays the booking form.
Step 3: User provides booking details.
Step 4: The system processes the payment.
Step 5: Confirmation message is sent to the user.
The SSD visually illustrates this step-by-step interaction to give a clear understanding of the system's behavior.

Communication Diagram
Overview
The Communication Diagram focuses on the interactions between objects or components of the system during the execution of a particular use case. It details how objects within the system communicate with one another to achieve the desired functionality.

Example: Communication during Booking Process
The user interacts with the BookingController to initiate the booking.
BookingController communicates with the PaymentService to handle payment.
Once the payment is successful, the BookingController updates the BookingDatabase and sends a confirmation to the UserInterface.
This diagram helps in understanding the roles of each component and their interactions within the system.

How to Read the Diagrams
Actors are represented by stick figures or symbols outside the system boundary.
Use Cases are depicted as ovals representing the functionalities of the system.
Messages and Interactions in sequence and communication diagrams are represented with arrows indicating the direction of communication.
Objects and Components are identified in communication diagrams, showing their interactions during the process.
Conclusion
This README provides a structured overview of the Online Booking Store project, including detailed explanations of use case diagrams, fully dressed use cases, system sequence diagrams, and communication diagrams. These diagrams serve as valuable tools for understanding the system's functionality and interaction patterns, making the project easier to implement and analyze.
